In this project, you are provided with a list of Transaction objects. The transactions can be accessed by calling DataUtil.getTransactions(), which returns an array of Transaction objects.


**Instructions**

**1.** Display all the transactions on a single screen in a list. For each transaction in the list, a user should be able to see the description, date, bank account, spending group, category, amount and currency symbol.

**2.** Each transaction also has a note field associated with it. This note can be long, so a user should be able to select a transaction to go to a screen which shows only the selected transaction, with all the previously mentioned data as well as the note.

**3.** The screen with the list of transactions should also have a header view. In this header, you should create a visualisation that visualises any interesting information about the transactions listed below it.
